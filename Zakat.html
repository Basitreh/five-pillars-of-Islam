    <h1>Zakat</h1>
    <p> Zakat is an obligatory charity which amounts to 2.5% of a person's cumulative wealth on a yearly basis. 
    This is only obligatory upon Muslims that have a certain amount of wealth called the nisab by scholars. Scholars 
    have different opinions on what is considered the nisab amount. </p>
