<h1>HAJJ</h1> 
<p>
    Once a year, Muslims that can afford it take a pilgrimage to Mecca where they visit the Kaaba.
    This pilgrimage is one of the 5 pilars of Islam. When the Hajj is completed, Eid ul adha is celebrated. 
    This eid is the one where Muslims sacrifice an animal for the sake of God, and share its meat with friends, family and the less fortunate.
